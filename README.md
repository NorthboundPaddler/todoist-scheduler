# ✅Todoist-Scheduler🕝
A simple, no-frills web interface to easily drag and drop a filtered list of tasks onto the day you want to do them.  

I'm a user of Carl Pullein's ["Time Sector System"](https://youtu.be/XRl3zkWAKvU) and the weekly review/scheduling of my upcoming tasks is tedious. This project aim's to help make that weekly review/scheduling as quick and painless as possible.

## Goals
- Easy to self-host
- No locally stored data
- Speed up weekly task reviews

## Design
- Kanban-board style interface for 5/7 days of the week
- Calendar view with condensed task count
- Sidebar with filter input box and resulting tasks in list below
- Settings page to enter API key and general appearance settings
